                We're Team Deadbolts, a brand-new FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team driven by curiosity, grit, and a
                mission to make STEM accessible for every student in our community.
                As a rookie team, we're starting from scratch with no robot parts, no tools, and no legacy infrastructure.
                But what we do have is passion, big ideas, and a team of high schoolers ready to take on the world.

                Our fundraising goal for this season is $30,000, which will cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Robot parts and competition materials</li>
                <li>Tools, electronics, and workspace equipment</li>
                <li>Competition registration fees</li>
                <li>Travel, lodging, and transportation</li>
                <li>Outreach events and STEM education initiatives</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We can't do it alone. That's where you come in.</p>
